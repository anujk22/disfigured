            For people who cannot or do not yet want to enter formal therapy, a well-run peer community offers an alternative way to process appearance-related experiences: it can turn private shame into shared language, transform "I'm overreacting" into "this is a pattern other people see too," and provide scripts and strategies that can be tested in the real world.

            At the same time, this platform is not a clinical intervention. It cannot replace structured treatment for severe anxiety or depression, and it should not present itself as doing so. A long-term version of the project would involve collaborating with clinicians and researchers who study online interventions to refine prompts, content warnings, and escalation pathways for users who may need more intensive support.

            The site is meant to stay experimental and responsive: moderation rules, reflection prompts, and interface choices would be updated based on what users report as helpful or harmful, as well as on outcome measures like engagement, self-reported confidence in social situations, and perceived sense of community. In this way, the project frames "judgment-free" not as a static promise, but as a standard the community continually works toward through design, enforcement, and collective learning.
