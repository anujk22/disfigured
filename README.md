## 📋 About

Disfigured is a proposal for a semi-anonymous, moderated online peer community designed to support people with visible facial differences. This website presents research-backed design decisions, safeguards, and reflections on creating judgment-free digital spaces.

The project explores how online platforms can provide accessible mental health support that sits between "no help at all" and formal therapy—offering peer connection, practical coping strategies, and community validation without requiring clinical appointments or face-to-face vulnerability.

**Note:** This is a hypothetical project created for academic purposes. The platform described is not currently operational.
